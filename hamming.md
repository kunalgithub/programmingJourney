Hamming Numbers 
----------------

The exact solution is not dictated here. This is my journey and what I learn from each Programming Kata I solve.

I cam across hamming sequence on CodeWars. 

On wikipedia , it is defined as smooth numnber whose factors are prime and factors is not greater than 5. So 2,3 and 5 can only be the factors. 

If you follow the link in Citiations section of wikipedia it will lead you to **internetArchive**. 

- You can borrow books for varied times and maxium upto 14 days 

- The citiation points to a solution by Dijikstra. 


So i went ahead and borrowed this book for a period of 14 days. 

Reading is tough with all the mathematical symbols 

My aim is not to look at solutions on the internet. This way i can bend my mind and do the hard work. 
Only then I can achieve profecieny. However such day is far but I should not stop my journey.
